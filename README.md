This collection of programs addresses the following coding challenges:

1. **Program for Student Marks Input:**
   - The program prompts the user to input student marks.

2. **Car Speed Demerit Point Calculator:**
   - The program takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80 km/h).
   - If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok."
   - If the speed exceeds 70 km/h, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), the driver receives one demerit point. The program then prints the total number of demerit points.

3. **Employee Salary Calculator:**
   - The program takes the basic salary and benefits of an employee as input.
   - It calculates the Payee Tax (15% of the basic salary), NHIF Deductions (fixed amount of 5000), NSSF Deductions (10% of the basic salary), and net salary (total earnings minus deductions).

Each program is designed to address a specific task as outlined in the challenges.
